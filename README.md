# Hacking for Solution Engineers 

A place to learn how to build geo apps with the ArcGIS API for JavaScript.

## Welcome

This repository contains short labs that step you through the process of developing a web application with ArcGIS API for JavaScript. 


## Resources

Here are the resources you will use for the labs.

* [ArcGIS for Developers - Account, Documentation, Samples, Apps, Downloads](http://developers.arcgis.com)
* [Esri Open Source Projects - More source code](http://esri.github.io)
* [JS Bin - Interactive JS coding](http://jsbin.com)
* [A simple guide for setting up a local web server (optional)](https://gist.github.com/jgravois/5e73b56fa7756fd00b89)
* [Help with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript](http://w3schools.com)

## Labs

The labs start from ground-zero and work through the accessing different aspects of the API and how to begin to build an application and add functionality.

Let's get started!

### Labs

* Lab 1:  [Review HTML, CSS, and JavaScript](./labs/review/lab1.md)
* Lab 2:  [Build a Starter Map](./labs/jsapi3/create_starter_map/lab.md)
* Lab 3:  [Add Feature Layer](./labs/jsapi3/add_feature_layer/lab.md)
* Lab 4:  [Style Feature Layer](./labs/jsapi3/style_feature_layer/lab.md)
* Lab 5:  [Style a layer popup](./labs/jsapi3/style_simple_popup/lab.md)
 * [Search with a Widget](./labs/jsapi3/search_with_widget/lab.md)
 * [Search with a Query Task](./labs/jsapi3/search_with_query_task/lab.md)
 * [Client-side Buffering](./labs/jsapi3/fixed_buffer_with_geometry_engine/lab.md)
 * [Client-side Buffering with UI](./labs/jsapi3/buffer_with_geometry_engine/lab.md)
 * [Create a JS API 3.x WebMap App](../labs/jsapi3/webmap_apps/create_jsapi3_app/lab.md)

You can see a high-level overview of the differences between the 3.x and 4.x JS APIs [here](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/guide/choose-version/index.html) and a more detailed comparison [here](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/guide/functionality-matrix/index.html).

* JS API
 * [Build a Starter Map](./develop/jsapi/create_starter_map/lab.md)
 * [Build a Starter 3D Map](./develop/jsapi/create_starter_map_3d/lab.md)
 * [Add Feature Layer](./develop/jsapi/add_feature_layer/lab.md)
 * [Add Vector Tile Layer](./develop/jsapi/add_vector_tile_layer/lab.md)
 * [Style Feature Layer](./develop/jsapi/style_feature_layer/lab.md)
 * [Style Feature Layer with JSON](./develop/jsapi/style_feature_layer_with_json/lab.md)
 * [Extrude data as Polygons in 3D](./develop/jsapi/extrude_polygon_3d/lab.md)
 * [Style a layer popup](./develop/jsapi/style_simple_popup/lab.md)
 * [Search with a Widget](./develop/jsapi/search_with_widget/lab.md)
 * [Search with a Query Task](./develop/jsapi/search_with_query_task/lab.md)
 * [Client-side Buffering](./develop/jsapi/buffer_with_geometry_engine/lab.md)
 * [Client-side Buffering with UI](./develop/jsapi/buffer_with_geometry_engine_and_slider/lab.md)

The above labs all use the 4.x JS API. If you would rather learn about the 3.x JS API, check [here](./develop/jsapi3/README.md).
