# Hacking for Solution Engineers 

A place to learn how to build geo apps with the ArcGIS API for JavaScript.

## Welcome

This repository contains short labs that step you through the process of developing a web application with ArcGIS API for JavaScript. 


## Resources

Here are the resources you will use for the labs.

* [ArcGIS for Developers - Account, Documentation, Samples, Apps, Downloads](http://developers.arcgis.com)
* [Esri Open Source Projects - More source code](http://esri.github.io)
* [JS Bin - Interactive JS coding](http://jsbin.com)
* [A simple guide for setting up a local web server (optional)](https://gist.github.com/jgravois/5e73b56fa7756fd00b89)
* [Help with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript](http://w3schools.com)

## Labs

The labs start from ground-zero and work through the accessing different aspects of the API and how to begin to build an application and add functionality.

Let's get started!

### Version 4.9

* Lab 1:  [Review HTML, CSS, and JavaScript](./labs/review/lab1.md)
* Lab 2:  [Build a Starter Map](./labs/jsapi/create_starter_map/lab.md)
* Lab 3:  [Build a Starter 3D Map](./labs/jsapi/create_starter_map_3d/lab.md)
* Lab 3:  [Add Feature Layer](./labs/jsapi/add_feature_layer/lab.md)
* Lab 4:  [Style Feature Layer](./labs/jsapi/style_feature_layer/lab.md)
* Lab 14: [Extrude data as Polygons in 3D](./labs/jsapi/extrude_polygon_3d/lab.md)
* Lab 5:  [Style a layer popup](./labs/jsapi/style_simple_popup/lab.md)
* Lab 6:  [Search with a Widget](./labs/jsapi/search_with_widget/lab.md)
* Lab 7:  [Search with a Query Task](./labs/jsapi/search_with_query_task/lab.md)
* Lab 8:  [Client-side Buffering](./labs/jsapi/buffer_with_geometry_engine/lab.md)
* Lab 20: [Create a JS API 4.x WebMap App](./labs/webmap_apps/create_jsapi_app/lab.md)
* Lab 21: [Create a JS API 4.x WebScene App](./labs/webmap_apps/create_jsapi_scene_app/lab.md)

You can see a high-level overview of the differences between the 3.x and 4.x JS APIs [here](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/guide/choose-version/index.html) and a more detailed comparison [here](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/guide/functionality-matrix/index.html).
